# Image Processing Server

This server processes image data received from the frontend and sends it to a Python server for classification.

## Author Information

- **Author**: Tega Osowa

- **GitHub**: [OsoTega](https://github.com/OsoTega)

## Description

This server is built with Express.js and TensorFlow.js to process image data. It receives image arrays from the frontend, converts them into the specified shape for prediction using TensorFlow.js, and then sends the data to a Python Flask server for classification.

## License

This project is open source and free to use.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OsoTega/pet_classifier_server_js.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /classify**: Receives image array from the frontend, processes it, and sends it to the Python server for classification. Returns the classification result.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `cors`: Middleware for Express.js to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing request bodies.

## Usage

Send a POST request to `/classify` endpoint with JSON data containing image array from the frontend. The server will process the image data and return the classification result.

Example usage:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9]}' http://localhost:8080/classify
```
